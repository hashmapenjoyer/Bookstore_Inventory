# Bookstore_Inventory

My implementation of a coding project I found described here: 
Serendipity Booksellers is a small bookstore located in a shopping mall. They have a cashier station equipped with a personal computer. The manager wants you to develop a point-of-sale (POS) software package that will make the computer function as a cash register and keep an inventory file. The inventory file will be a database of all the books in the bookstore. In general, the software is to perform the following tasks: • Calculate the total of a sale, including sales tax • When a book is purchased, subtract it from the inventory file • Add, change, delete, and look up books in the inventory file • Display various sales reports
